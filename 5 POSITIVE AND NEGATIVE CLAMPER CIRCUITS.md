# Result

The Positive and Negative Clamper circuits were successfully constructed and tested. 
The positive clamper shifted the waveform upward by clamping the negative peaks to 0 V, 
while the negative clamper shifted the waveform downward by clamping the positive peaks to 0 V. 
Thus, both clampers operated correctly.
